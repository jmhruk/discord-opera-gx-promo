# Discord OperaGX promo code
Repository on a simple python script to generate free trial nitro codes. (Only works when trial request link is active)

# How does this work?
It uses the python requests module to send a request to discord's opera gx promo code api, it then logs the response as a link in the designated text file.

The program is pretty simple to read so just open main.py

Feel free to use at your own risk :)
